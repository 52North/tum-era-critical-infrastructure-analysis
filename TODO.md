# TODOs

## Check Chile files, that doesn't work at the moment

## Extension for multiple intensity values to put in the fragility functions
For lahars is will be important to read from velicity and height
of the lahar as intensity measurements.
At the moment those files are ascii grids, so there is the need
to read several raster files for the intensity provider there.

The even more important part will be to access the fragility functions
here as we will need do set two (or more) values in there. Also there
wont be a lognormal continous distribution, but more a logic approach.
